            <h1>about you</h1>
            <p>I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.If I had a flower for every time I thought of you. I could walk through my garden forever.You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and most beautiful person I have ever known and even that is an understatement.I love you for all that you are, all that you have been and all that you will be.To the world you may be one person, but to one person you are the world.</p>

            <p>I wake up every day with your smile on my mind.
                It’s a beautiful sight to behold, so soft and so kind.
                My dreams are filled with the thought of me and you.
                I awake and smile, for my dreams have come true.
                I have you to guide me through my troubles and fears.

                When I say goodbye, promise me you won’t cry,

                Honey, come a little closer,
                let me whisper in your ear.
                Let me tell it to you softly,
                So that no one else will hear.
                What I have to say is private,
                and is just between us two;
